My name is Phill, I'm a Software Engineer born in Sydney, Australia. I love building human-centered products that are carefully crafted, delightful to use and enrich the lives of the people that use them.

I like to work on teams of smart, and passionate people to collaborate together on solving difficult problems and to challenge each other to grow and learn. I thrive in an environment that embraces challenges; taking the path of greatest impact over the path of least resistance.

I value effective communication above all, and being aware of the effects that we have on the people and the world around us.

When not writing software, I'm [shooting photos](https://instagram.com/phillfarrugia) of the incredible people, places and things that I experience around me. I've written about how I've [developed my photographic process](https://medium.com/@phillfarrugia/developing-a-photographic-process-462207566a59) over the years. I love to travel, hike and go camping in the most beautiful places in California.

I've given [talks](https://github.com/phillfarrugia/talks) at local iOS meetups in Sydney, Melbourne and San Francisco. Talking about the ways people build teams, challenging assumptions about building products and sharing my experiences with others as much as possible.

I'm the organizer of a local San Francisco based Product Design meetup called [Product Of SFO](https://www.meetup.com/Product-Of-SFO/). We gather together regularly to drink coffee, help each other through roadblocks, get feedback on side projects and to get to know a diverse range of likeminded people.
